# Invisionapp
Building a test app from Invisionapp.

The easiest way to see this in action, is to go this link: http://invisionapp.surge.sh/.

If you'd like to do it the hard way, you can clone the repo, change directory into the repo and run this command (must have npm installed): `npm install && npm start`.

Also, be sure to open up your dev tools and view this in mobile, since that's pretty much what its optimized for.
